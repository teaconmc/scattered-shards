**Scattered Shards** adds a system of collectible "shards" that can be created via a UI and placed in-world.

The *Shard Collection* shows obtained and missing shards. It can be accessed from the pause menu, or via hotkey (J).

Hold shift while viewing your shard collection to see overall completion, as well as shard rarity.

**Features:**
- Shards can have titles, descriptions, and face art in the form of item stacks or arbitrary textures
  - Shards can also have a "hint", which is shown in standard galactic until moused over
- Shards have a "type" e.g. clubs, foil, rare, secret, difficult (data-driven)
  - Shard types can have custom names, textures, and collection sounds (resource-driven)
- Shards are arranged into "sets" which can have one shard of each type
	- Suggested as **installed mod IDs** by default, but can be completely arbitrary (locations, skillsets, etc)

### Shard Creation

- Run `/shardc creator new [set] [type]` to open the shard creator - set can be an arbitary ID
  - In the shard creator, you can fill in the title, description, hint, and icon for the shard
  - If you used an installed mod ID for the set, you can enable "use mod icon" to use the mod icon
- To allow regular players to collect the shard, either:
  - Run `/shard block [shard]` and place the provided block - this collects the shard when walking over
  - Place a command block with e.g. `/shard award @n [shard]` - this collects the shard for the nearest player
