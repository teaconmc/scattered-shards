**Scattered Shards** is a collectible system designed for events like [ModFest](https://modfest.net) and BlanketCon. From an event-running standpoint, it lets booth builders create personalized in-world challenges for their mods with **shards** as the reward! Players can keep track of their collection progress using the **Shard Tablet**.

### Basic Rundown

- See [this guide](https://github.com/ModFest/scattered-shards/wiki/Creating-Shard-Types) to learn how to create **shard types**.
- Run `/shardc creator new ...` in-game to create a new shard.
- Run `/shard block <your_shard_id>` to get a placeable version of the shard.
- Place it down... then run into it and see what happens!

### Interested?

Scattered Shards is pretty esoteric, so if you're interested in using the mod for your own events, we'd love to help you get started. Head over to [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/cmVKB2Z464) and chat with us in the `#scattered-shards` channel if you have any questions!
